# Flickr Browser

In the long term, a client-side app for browsing exported Flickr photos and metadata.

In the short term, an excuse to play around with some fun new JS tools, like RequireJS, underscore, Backbone, Mustache, Bower, etc.

## Setup

Use [Bower](http://twitter.github.com/bower/) to install required packages 

From `js/` run `bower install`
